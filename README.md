- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Kingston. 
- 👀 I’m interested in how data science and machine learning can be used to improve real world, outcomes. I'm  interested in issues like: economic development, poverty, the balance between the need for environmental sustainablility and human development.
- I love kaggle. I won a bronze medal earlier in 2022 in the Pawpularity competition, and I hope to win a second medal in the current Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction competition. I'm currently in 30th / 1176, with 5 weeks to go. Fingers crossed!
